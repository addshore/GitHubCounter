A Safari extension that displays releases downloads counter.

### How to install:

- Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/aonez/GitHubCounter/releases/latest) or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/aonez/GitHubCounter/releases) page.

### Using Chrome?

- Just use [chrome-github-release-downloads](https://github.com/addshore/chrome-github-release-downloads) from @addshore, as this one is based on it.

### It uses:

- `contentscript.js` from [chrome-github-release-downloads](https://github.com/addshore/chrome-github-release-downloads), many thanks to @addshore work. It is all the code this extension runs.

- Icon based on Nick Roach (http://www.elegantthemes.com) work. Actual icon can be found [here](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1055068/arrow_cloud_down_download_icon#size=512).
