![GitHubCounter Icon](https://github.com/aonez/GitHubCounter/blob/master/GitHubCounter.safariextension/icon-128.png)

A Safari extension that displays releases downloads counter.

### How to install:

Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/aonez/GitHubCounter/releases/latest) or go to the [Releases](https://github.com/aonez/GitHubCounter/releases) page and choose your prefered version.

### How it works:

It just shows the downloads count near each release in GitHub. No toolbar elements, no bars, nothing else.

An example:

### Using Chrome?

Just use [chrome-github-release-downloads](https://github.com/addshore/chrome-github-release-downloads) from @addshore, as this one is based on it.

### It uses:

- `contentscript.js` from [chrome-github-release-downloads](https://github.com/addshore/chrome-github-release-downloads), many thanks to @addshore work. It is all the code this extension runs.

- Icon based on Nick Roach (http://www.elegantthemes.com). Actual icon can be found [here](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1055068/arrow_cloud_down_download_icon#size=512).
