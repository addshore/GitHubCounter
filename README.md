# GitHubCounter
A Safari extension that displays releases downloads counter.

It uses:

- `contentscript.js` from [chrome-github-release-downloads](https://github.com/addshore/chrome-github-release-downloads), many thanks to @addshore work. It is all the code this extension runs.

- Icon based on Nick Roach work, http://www.elegantthemes.com. Actual icon can be found [here](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1055068/arrow_cloud_down_download_icon#size=512).
